This Django project aims to implement a tourism website that offers customers the opportunity to purchase a trip to the geographical area of ​​Romania called Bucovina.
The entire website has been created to facilitate end-customers access in a user-friendly manner.
The site offers functionalities such as: users, group trips, services, filters, categories.
The application provides the user with functionalities such as LogIn/LogOut and password change.
In addition to the above, the app has two more functionalities, one called "trip" and the other "category", each of which has a sub-category, namely "create trip" and "create category".
The category application is intended only for the administrator or users with administrator rights.
The customer has access to the entire list of trips as well as a functionality that sends the customer to the list of all available tours called "all trips".
